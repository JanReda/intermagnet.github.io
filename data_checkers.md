 ### Data Quality Checking
 Annual definitive data from all INTERMAGNET magnetic observatories (IMOs) are carefully prepared and checked for quality and compliance in a three stage process before they are accepted and published:
 -  The IMOs prepare one calendar year of definitive data to meet INTERMAGNET standards and submit for review by their allocated member of the Data Checking Task Team.
 -  Data are checked by the Data Checking Task Team member and, once approved, submitted for a final review.
 -  Data are reviewed by the chair of the INTERMAGNET Definitive Data subcommittee for final approval and publication.

This multi-stage checking procedure does mean there can be delays of at least 18 months before definitive data sets are published, but it ensures definitive data are of the highest possible quality.

Remark JRD: 

It seems to me that it is important to clarify 18 months. 18 months concerns a annual set of entire INTERMAGNET network (CD /DVD/USB/IRDS) only. Definitive data set of individual IMO is published earlier, sometimes even before deadline announced in call for data.

Data with a lower level of quality checking are available in a faster time-frame. Some IMOs provide "reported"  quality data in near-real time, all IMOs provide "reported" data within
three days and many IMOs supply "adjusted" and "quasi-definitive" data. All these data are available from the INTERMAGNET [website](http://www.intermagnet.org/data-donnee/download-eng.php) and [ftp site](ftp://ftp.seismo.nrcan.gc.ca/intermagnet)

JRD:

I tried put links to INTERMAGNET web and ftp, but couldn't.

 ### Data Checking Task Team
The detailed work of definitive data review and checking is done by a group of expert volunteers, each responsible for a group of IMOs.
The review process includes reviewing the quality of data and baseline adoptions, and checking file formats and metadata for compliance with INTERMAGNET standards.

IMO personel, the Data Checking Task Team members and their institutes all benefit through the communications and learning fostered by the checking process.
Data users can be confident definitive data from INTERMAGNET magnetic observatories are of the highest quality.
